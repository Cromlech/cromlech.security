0.2 (2012-05-01)
----------------

- `Interaction` context managers do now stack in a graceful way.
  The security context is saved and restaured and can be extended
  or ignored for the time of the controlled execution.

- Added a decorator that can wrap component lookup results into
  a security proxy. This very generic decoration process can be
  used on any kind of function or method that returns a wrappable
  object.
